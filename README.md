I'm a former small business owner transitioning into the infotech world...currently honing my skills in my quest to become an authority in the cybersecurity field. My experiences and skills have grown from a deep desire to keep people and things safe. I like to put myself in someone else's shoes and figure out how I would like to be treated if I were them. I want safe connections and having my privacy respected so my goal as a Cybersecurity Professional is to keep a watchful eye against invasions of private and confidential information.

I believe there is always something to be learned, especially with the rapid pace of information technology and cybersecurity. There's always something new. I enjoy examining ways to gain different perspectives and points of view. My perpetual curiosity drives the analytical side of my brain and I use it to solve problems, promote change, and positively impact my work.
